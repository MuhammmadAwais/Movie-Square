‚ú® Features
MovieSquare is packed with features designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable movie browsing experience:

‚ö°Ô∏è Optimized Live Search: Search for movies in real-time with an intelligent search function. I've implemented debouncing to optimize performance, ensuring that API calls are only made when necessary, which prevents overloading the server and provides a smoother user experience.

üé¨ Detailed Movie Information: Click on any movie to view comprehensive details, including its title, official poster, user rating, and original language.

üì± Fully Responsive Design: The entire application is built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS, guaranteeing a flawless experience whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

üíé Beautiful & Modern UI: The user interface is crafted to be not only functional but also visually appealing, ensuring an engaging and pleasant browsing session.
